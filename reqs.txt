So i have a data frame with the columns "date" and "ip" ,date contains a datestring and ip contains an ip address. Each row represents a request. date  range is about 5 hours.

- i want to graph how many requests per second each ip makes.

- I want to see how many requests an ip is making relative to the other ips at the same time period.

- i can't tell if each ip is making more or few requests per second at a specific time period

- I really want the y column to [be] request per time period (min/ 15 min), and x be time. each line being each ip. I was trying to group by hour or minute.

- So, what I would expect is like like 3 or so lines (for each ip) going up and down over time

- it would be nice to have them overlayed to see if they are using them at the same time or rotating through them

So, what he wants to see is a trace for each IP that shows how many times it's connected in a specific time period. Each line represents an IP address.  The X axis shows time, the Y axis is number of requests during that time period.
